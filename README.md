Note: This is my very first Chrome Extension, so expect the code to be rough and suboptimal. Feel free to school me and/or submit issues/PRs detailing how I can improve it.

TikTok is a bit of a guilty pleasure, but due to lots of privacy concerns I don't have it installed on my phone and usually consume its content on the web. The web version unfortunately though does not have any way to tweak the volume of the videos being played, which can result in being startled quite a bit as the sound differs a lot between creators.

This simple extension adds an overlay to the page allowing you to control the volume of all videos. It also stores and syncs this volume across page-loads, though this functionality appears to be a little flaky.
